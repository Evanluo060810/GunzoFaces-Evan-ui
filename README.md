Core Principle: No changes to functional logic, file references, or data storage addressesâ€”focus solely on UI/UX enhancements.
Key Changes:
Redundant Content Removal: Eliminated unnecessary acknowledgment sections (e.g., credits to FMGUNZO, Karnas) to streamline the interface.
UI Visual Upgrade:
Adopted a consistent dark theme with CSS variables for color standardization, plus gradient backgrounds and subtle textures to enhance visual depth.
Refined card-based layout, buttons, and form elements (inputs, dropdowns, sliders) with unified borders, rounded corners, and shadow effects. Added polished details like gradient dividers and grid backgrounds for preview areas.
Applied gradient text for headings and visual indicators for info sections to boost professional aesthetics.
UX Improvements:
Added rich interactive feedback (hover lift, shadow transitions, scaling effects) for buttons, sliders, and form elements.
Implemented tooltips for intuitive operation guidance; added hover states for the canvas and preview areas for clearer interaction feedback.
Layout & Responsiveness Optimization:
Utilized Flexbox and percentage-based widths to optimize element spacing and reduce visual clutter.
Integrated media queries to enable vertical layout adaptation on mobile devices, preventing overflow on small screens and improving cross-device compatibility.
